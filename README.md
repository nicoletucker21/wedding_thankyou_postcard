Don't want to write and address all of your wedding gift thank you cards by hand? 
Use this python script to automate it, and even customize each card by category and gift!

FILES REQUIRED FOR CODE TO RUN CORRECTLY:

1. people_gifts.csv

This file is a list of all the people who gave you a wedding gift, including their full name (couples or family names combined), the item gifted, the category of the gift, and the full mailing address of the gift giver.

2. message.csv

This file is a list of all the messages you want printed on your postcards, organized by gift category.
The code is written so that gift data is inserted into the message, so feel free write a specific message for each cateogory and include the word GIFT where you want the gift data inserted!

This file is the photo or design for the back of your postcard. Make sure it is also 300 DPI.

5. font files (.otf or .ttf)
